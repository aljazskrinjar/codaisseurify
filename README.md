# Codaisseurify
First and second homework from Codaisseur Academy

This rails application imitates spotify. You can delete Artist, add song, delete song and delete all songs. I wrote adding and deleting songs by using AJAX calls.

## Work in progress
I have intention to style this app a bit more.


## Running Locally
